# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone
Final/Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate Course offered on Coursera. I chose to complete the Bellabeat case study track. Here is a link to my certificate: https://www.credly.com/badges/e86b9632-61ac-443c-9524-a34ce1842be1/linked_in

## Disclaimer:
Due to high margin of error from the small sample size and lack of demographic information, this case study is more an indicator of my analytical ability than a legitimate series of actionable insights. Below is a more detailed explanation of this conclusion.

• Let’s say that we just want to market to Americans. According to an external study (https://ouhsc.edu/bserdac/dthompso/web/gait/knmatics/stride.htm), 1 in 5 Americans (67 million Americans) own a wearable fitness tracker.
• If we wanted our sample size to provide us with an accurate analysis (with 95% confidence level and 5% margin of error) of American fitness tracker user behavior we would want a sample size of 385.
• For this analysis we have user data from 33 users which gives us a margin of error of 17% for an analysis of the American public which is well beyond the generally healthy margin of error range of 4%-8%.3 
• Our sample size might suffice for a smaller demographic, perhaps the population of a smaller area but since we have no demographic information we cannot accurately attach the data to a more specific region/location.
